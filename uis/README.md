# `uis` folder

This folder contains **all projects with a user interface** for the cross-functional AI Engineering company project — for example: a public website, admin dashboard frontend, ecommerce UI, customer portals, Streamlit/Gradio app or other frontend-only tools.

The two main projects stored here are:

- **`website`** — the company's public-facing web presence.
- **`backoffice`** — the internal admin application. This is the ideal place to develop multiple solutions within a single project: authentication, people management, operations management, internal communication, and other back-office capabilities.

## Implemented Applications

- [TrackFlow public website](./website/README.md): company landing page, logistics inquiry form, and privacy preview. Semantic HTML and JavaScript with Vite and Tailwind CSS. Run from `uis/website` with `npm ci` and `npx vite --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5173`.

Organize `uis/` by **different concerns** — each subfolder covers a distinct area of the company (for example, public web vs internal operations) and includes its own technical and functional documentation.

- **Main purpose**: to centralize in a single place all frontend applications that support the company's use cases.
- **Recommendation**: document in this file (or in sub-READMEs) the applications you add, their objective, the technology used, and how to run them.
